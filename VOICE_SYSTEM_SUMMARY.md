GET  /api/rag/stats                                 # All clients stats
DELETE /api/rag/clients/{clientId}                  # Delete knowledge base
```

### Traditional Voice Commands
```
POST /api/voice/command                              # Process voice command
GET  /api/voice/actions/{context}                    # Get available actions
POST /api/voice/context                              # Update UI context
```
